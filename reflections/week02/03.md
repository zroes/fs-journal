## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

- The two main ways are using console.log and console.error. Most of the time we'll be using console.log to verify values and ensure things are working the way we expect them to. console.error is useful for notifying us when things are _really_ not working

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS, and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- Elements tab and styles tab. These are useful because they let us change things on our page and see them in real time. This is faster than needing to switch back-and-forth between our code and the browser constantly. 

3. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? 

- Using the debugger built into javascript
