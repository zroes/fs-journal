## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- The main way of writing a function is with the function keyword. A function can also be created anonymously (unnamed), which is useful if we only want to use the function once to assign a variable or something like that. Arrow function syntax is identical to anonymous functions, but a bit quicker to write. 

2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?

- parameters are used when creating a function, while arugments are what actually get passed into the function.

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

- A higher-order function is a function that takes in other functions as parameters. A common example would be something like the Array.filter() function

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I ended up creating a higher-order function in my package filter assignment. I deleted it because it made my code very hard to explain and understand. Focus on readability!
