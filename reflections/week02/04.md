## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan for your application before starting to write the code?

- Having a roadmap to follow while programming is a lot easier than coding ideas as they come.
  It gives you to think about your code before actually taking the time to write it. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

- Take the time to try and solve it on my own, but keep track of the time and don't waste time solving a problem I can't solve. Google is a great resource, and often a short break is all it takes to find the solution. I could also always ask someone for help.

3. What coding mistakes would you be most likely to make? What advice from this article do you find most helpful?

- I can deifnitely see myself picking the first solution I come up with, rather than trying to find something better. I also will usually just throw myself into a problem rather than trying to plan ahead and break the problem into smaller pieces.
