## Questions

1. What is ***scope***?

- Scope is the section of code that a variable is defined in. As the article explained, the problem with var is that it is globally scoped while let and const are block scoped.

2. What is ***Hoisting***?

- In JavaScript, variables are hoisted to the top of their scope. That is, they are declared but unassigned at the top of their scope, and then get assigned normally. 

3. In what cases might you use `let` vs. `const` vs. `var`?

- 99% of the time I will want to use let or const, because they make more sense to me in terms of scope. const is useful for when I want things to be unchanged, or constant (wow!)
