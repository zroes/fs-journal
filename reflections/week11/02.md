## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`

- A primary key refers to the main key used to access an item in a db, usually an id of some sort, while the foreign key typically refers to primary key of a different database -> vault.creatorId and account.id

2. What is an ***alias***?

- A different name for something, similar to a variable

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorspat (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
);
```
- SELECT p.*, docpat.* FROM doctorspat docpat JOIN patients pat ON pat.id = docpat.patientId WHERE docpat.doctorId = @DoctorId
