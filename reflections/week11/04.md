## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

- I simply plan on making effecient use of my time at Codeworks to get things done in a timely manner. The Capstone projects was pretty fun, I think that although the pair programming exercises were sometimes a bit awkward, they were probably some of the most beneficial exercises and some of my favorites.
