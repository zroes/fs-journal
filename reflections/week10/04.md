> **ðŸ“– [C# Enums](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/03-Enums)**

## Questions

1. What is an ***Enum***, and what are some use cases for them?

- A strongly typed constant value, mainly used for strictly assigning values to data.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

- dot notation 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far? (if you have not yet, give an example of how you could.)

- I haven't used them in c#, but I can definitely see them being useful. In js, they were useful for using categories, and ensuring that the string category could only be 1 of a few possible values.
