## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- value type, reference type, pointer type.
they differ in how and where they store their data.

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

- value types are simple, single values of data. ie: int, char, bool, etc. C# has a lot more data types than js.

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

- I don't fully understand, but rather than storing a piece of data directly in a variable, a reference type holds the address to where the data is stored. It references data that is stored elsewhere, rather than keeping the data directly.
