## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

- a row will essentially hold a single item, with lots of different values. Essentially an object.
- a column holds all the same data types, like all the ids across every item. Like a category.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called "characters" with the values "name, age, description" as strings, and an `int` id.

- ```sql
  CREATE TABLE characters(
  name varchar(255),
  age varchar(100),
  description varchar(500),
  id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
  ) DEFAULT CHARSET utf8mb4;```

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- delete from will remove a single item (row) from the table, while drop table will delete that entire table from the db.
