# Final Reflection
The final week, the final day of coursework. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
`I was able to finish my project rather quickly, and I got a duck on my first grading`
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
`I'm struggling with how to approach the networking and career stuff. I think I have a tendency to overthink things, and just an overall lack of confidence that whoever I'm reaching out to wants to talk with me at all.`
- What would you count as a victory?
