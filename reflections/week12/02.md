# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? Are you working from client -> server or focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
`Today is going pretty well, my homepage is looking good and I've been working on the profile page. I decided to forgo the account page completely and just modify the profile page slightly for the logged in user. I've noticed a lot of requirements on the vault page, which has me a bit worried.`
- Are you managing your stress?
`yeah`
- What has you most worried?
`I'm starting to glimpse past the end of this project, and I'm worried about career week`
