# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is your Vue application shaping up? Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page?  

## Prompts
- How is today going?
`Good, I managed to finish up the vault page and went in for my first grading today. I had 2 tiny things that I missed, but I was able to correct them after getting graded and earned my golden duck :)`
- Are you managing your stress?
`I'm trying to, but I'm really starting to worry about the job hunt and career week. I'm fairly confident in my ability to learn, and to code at a smaller scale like we've been doing, but I have very little confidence when it comes to working on a larger team, and I just don't really know how my skills will transfer to the workplace.`
- What has you most worried?
`Working on LinkedIn and my resume.`
