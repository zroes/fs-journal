# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
`Today is going pretty well, most of my backend is done already, so I've started working on the Homepage`
- Are you managing your stress?
`I typically manage my stress pretty well, since it's only Monday I'm not feeling too stressed yet. `
- What has you most worried?
`Right now, nothing seems like it will be too bad. I'm worried about missing some stuff with the UI, but I'm sure anything I miss in the first grading can be fixed easily by the second grading.`
