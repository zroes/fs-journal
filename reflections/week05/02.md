## Questions

1. What are the three types of data relationships?

- one to one, one to many, and many to many

2. What are the benefits of traditional ***linking*** relationships over ***embedding*** relationships?

- linking keeps the data separate from each other, meaning that more comments won't grow the document size (allowing users to grow the document size means it's technically possible to make the file size too big). It's also easier to separate the many items into pages.

3. When modeling data, it's important to consider how a user will use and filter that data. How does this affect the way you model a ***many-to-many*** relationship? 

- depending on how you intend the data to be used and accessed, you will want to change how you organize the data in your database.
