## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?

- wireframing is a cheap and easy way to prototype out a design to share with people. They can be useful to gauge user feedback as well.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wireframes, and why is each one useful?

- lo-fidelity, often hand sketched, is useful for deciding on the flow of an application, and the general format of where things will be. 

- mid-fidelity works as a middle-ground between lo and high. Layouts are more accurate than on a lo-fidelity wireframe, and things is more detailed overall.

- hi-fidelity is essentially a pixel-accurate depiction of a website, and serves one of the main resources during the web-design process. 

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- I think they usually are, especially if someone else is making them. :) In general though its much easier to decide how a website should look when you can see it visually. It's much more time consuming to resize an element on a site than it is to work with something like figma.
