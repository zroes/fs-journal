## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

- a psuedo-class, or psuedo-selector is used to define a special state for an element. The most common one I can see myself using would be :hover, to change buttons or navigation menus when the cursor hovers over them.

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

- specificity determines which styles are applied to which elements, in the situation where multiple styles are applied to the same element. A brief example is that something like `div` would be less specific than a class selector `.small` which would be less specific than a id selector `#confirm`. The more specific something is, the higher priority it gets. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

- because `!important` has very high specificity, it would overwrite any other styles applied to an element, and more importantly can't be overwritten by other elements. Overusing it could lead to bugs where your website doesn't change when you want it to.
