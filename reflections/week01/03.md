## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip for improving your design? How does it benefit your site?

- My favorite tip in the article was adding the colored rectangles to elements to make them pop out a bit more. It makes the UI feel more distinct and intentional. I also liked the tip of having shadows come from the bottom to simulate a light from above. 

2. Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- honestly that whole article was pretty solid, I'm sure I'll reread it whenever I'm having trouble designing my sites. 

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- One of the biggest priorities of designers is the hierarchy of elements on a page, and (for example) how making font smaller and lighter colored lets the user know it's less important. 

  A well designed, modern website is more reassuring to the people visiting it compared to something that feels like it was made 10 years ago.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I chose a website to clone that seemed more challenging, and I regret it a bit. It took a lot of time just getting the elements laid out, and I would have liked to spend more time working on scaling with bootstrap.
