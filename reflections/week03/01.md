## Questions

1. What problem does using ***exports*** solve?

- saves us from having to link a bunch of scripts in our html

2. How does `export` differ from `export default`?

- export default lets us import without declaring `import * as ____`
  there can also be multiple exports from a file, but only one export default

3. What is a benefit of using the "module" system?

- using modules makes code easier to debug, because we have multiple smaller files rather than a single giant file.
