> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the ***observer pattern*** seek to solve?

- the observer pattern seeks to solve the problem of updating a page in response to events. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- the subscribe method, unsubscribe method, and broadcast method

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template, and reflect on the `Proxy` objects from yesterday and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the DOM.

- the Proxy for appstate prevents users from directly manipulating the data in the appstate. The data stored there is safer than it was with a single js file. The observer I don't fully understand, but essentially it watches the page for events and updates the data in the appState when needed.
