## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

- Encapsulation keeps data hidden away in such a way that it can't be accessed by users. 

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

- The _ convention was not universally used or known, and it didn't actually do anything to keep data away from users, meaning that it wasn't very useful as a way of keeping data private. The biggest issue with closures was that developers didn't know how to use them. 

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

- we use #private #fields. This lets us declare values and makes it clear to people looking at our code that they are private. Furthermore, unlike and _, it actually keeps our variables private and is more than a common convention.
