> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of 'callback hell'?

- callback hell is typically a result of trying to write js in such a way that everything runs in order from top to bottom. It results in code that is rather messy and hard to read and intrepret, and especially hard to debug

2. What does ***asynchronous*** mean, and how are callbacks involved?

- asynchronous means that the code will be executed in the future, rather than directly when it is called. an async funtion that uses callback will not return anything right away, and instead will wait until the data is needed to return anything

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid/fix 'callback hell.'

- Make code 'shallow' (by keeping functions shorter and single-purpose)
- Modularize code (break into separate files)
- Handle every error (make code more robust)
