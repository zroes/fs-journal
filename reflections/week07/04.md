# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this week's readings did you implement?

 (I'm assuming this is about the checkpoint, and not the partner project from last week)
  - I mainly tried to follow the Figma to create a good UX, and I think it turned out well. I haven't really put any time into creating documentation for my code yet, but I can see how useful it is and will plan on implementing it in the future. I also think learning Typescript and using that to autogenerate docs would be interesting. 

2. What went well this week?

- I managed to finish my project in time, so thats good. I would have liked to polish a few things up more, but for now I'm pretty satisfied with what I made. 

3. What would you do differently?

- I probably should have spent more time focusing on core functionality before spending so much time styling.
