## Questions

1. What is the ***user experience***? What should be considered when developing to create a good UX?

- Instead of focusing on what you want the user to do on your site, think about what they want to do. Making it easy for them to accomplish their goals on your site is the most important aspect of UX.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the user experience?

- People will feel more satisfied with a website when they can easily use it, and so they're more likely to come back as repeat customers. 

3. Why is the user experience important?

- A bad ux will drive people away from your site; they will quickly become frustrated or confused while using your website and decide to leave and go somewhere else. A good ux will draw them in and cause them to spend more time on your site, meaning they're more likely to make a purchase.
