## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We're mainly connecting to the kroger and albertsons apis. We're also trying to incorporate scrum principles. 

2. What went well so far?

I think our idea is good, and we have good work ethic, but getting all the data we want to make our app useful has been difficult.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

If I could go back, I think I'd want to try contacting different grocery companies earlier on to see if we could gain access to more apis. I think we could have benefitted from implementing more scrum rituals as well.
