## Questions

1. What is a ***Base64 encoded image***?

It's essentially an image that has been encoded in text format.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 encoding?

It adds an extra translation layer, as the image needs to be decoded an extra time. Base64 images also can't be cached by the browser, or accessed via url, so they generally lead to a worse user experience. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Nowadays, computers and browsers are much faster than they used to be, and loading in multiple images at a time isn't nearly as big a problem as it used to be. Base64 allowed multiple images to be loaded at once, but that's not an issue anymore.
