## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

2. What adjustments from traditionally sized scrum teams need to be made to use the Agile methodology effectively in a small team?

- The article talks about making frequent use of Slack throughout the day to reduce the time spent in the scrum rituals.

3. What is the ***unattainable triangle***? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
