## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- unit test, component testing, and end2end testing.
  unit testing is testing a single unit of your code, often a function or group of functions. 
  component testing is testing an individual component
  e2e tests validate the entire flow of your application, checking every layer to make sure things work.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- If you can only have one, the most important is e2e as it validates your entire app and ensures its ready to ship. However, it's not super useful for intermediate testing while developing. I still see it as the most useful though because it can serve as a goal to aim for while developing, to pass all the e2e tests.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- I think component testing is probably the least useful. Unit testing is helpful for checking small bits of code, which I see as the most applicable in a dev enviroment. Code small, test small. And having the e2e test is what gives you the confidence to send your product out to the end user. Component testing, while useful, seeems like a middle ground that's missing the major advantages of the others.
