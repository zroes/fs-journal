<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
v-on and v-model
```

**2.** The `SPA` acronym stands for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Page application
```
**3.** What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A single page application doesn't need to fetch entirely new files for every page, and instead only swaps out certain components on each new page. In general they can be faster and more reactive than a traditional site. 
```
**4.** What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It will run whatever code is inside it when the page loads. 
```
**5.** What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It binds data to an element on the page using user input such such as the input tag. Its mainly been used for forms so far, but I could see it being useful to make a reactive search as well.
```
**6.** The `v:on` (`@`) directive can be used for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
clicks and submits usually.
```
**7.** Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
v-if, v-else, or v-show
```
**8.** What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It helps Vue with rendering and reactivity. Not strictly necessary but considered best practice.
```
**9.** What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

slot is for inserting components into other components
